# Standardised rates and ratios from cancer registry data
This repository uses data from Volume XII of the IARC’s “Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (CI5)” collaboration to work through an example of how we can calculate standardised rates and ratios from cancer registry data.  

**Full analysis page available at:** <https://anshu-uppal.github.io/cancer_registry/>  

The data pre-processing steps are done in the `01_prep.R` file in the `code` folder, and the main analysis is run from the Quarto document `02_analysis.qmd` file in the root directory.
